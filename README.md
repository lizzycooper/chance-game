# chance-game
The first program I ever wrote! Based on a lesson in Codecademy - Learn Python 3.

This game gives the player $100 to start with, and allows them to bet some of their money on the outcomes of a series of games based on chance.
- Coin flip; predict heads or tails
- Cho-Yan; predict whether the total of two dice will be odd or even
- Pick-a-card; where you and another player select a card from the deck, and you win if your card is higher than theirs
- Roulette; predict the right colour and win your bet, or predict the right number and win 35x your bet
